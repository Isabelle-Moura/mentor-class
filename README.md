# Mentor Class - Project Documentation

Mentor Class is an application for managing classes and students, designed to streamline the administration of mentors, mentorships, classes, and students. The application was built using JSON Server to simulate the backend and does not rely on any front-end frameworks, developed with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript to create the user interface and interactive functionalities.

## Technologies Used in the Project
The Mentor Class application was developed using the following technologies:

- JSON Server: Utilized to simulate the backend and provide endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Used to create the user interface and implement interactive logic in the application.

## Features

### Login
- Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials, ensuring secure access to the application's features.
- Error Handling: In case of invalid login credentials, appropriate error messages are displayed, allowing users to retry.
- Redirect: After successful login, users are redirected to the main dashboard to manage mentors, mentorships, classes, and students.

### Sign-up (New Users)
- Registration Form: New users can sign up for the application by filling out a registration form with required information such as name, email, and password.
- Input Validation: The sign-up form validates user input to ensure all necessary fields are completed and that the email is in the correct format.
- Error Handling: If there are any errors in the sign-up form, appropriate error messages are displayed, allowing users to correct their input.
- Successful Registration: Upon successful sign-up, users are registered in the system (localStorage) and can proceed to log in with their newly created credentials.

...

The login and sign-up screens are vital components of the Mentor Class application, providing secure access to authorized users and allowing new users to create accounts to use the platform's features. The login screen ensures that only registered users can access the application, while the sign-up screen enables new users to join and participate in mentorship management.
